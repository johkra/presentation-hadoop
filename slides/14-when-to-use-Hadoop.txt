Considerations:
	What limits my computation task?
	Can my computation be expressed using MapReduce?

When to use Hadoop:
	Data set very big. (does not fit in RAM)
	CPU limited.

When not to use Hadoop:
	Small tasks. (overhead)
	Data fits in RAM and computation is not CPU limited.
	Lots of intermediary data generated by map which has to be sent over
	the network.
	Computation can't be expressed using MapReduce.

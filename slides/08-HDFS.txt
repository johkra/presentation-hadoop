Need to get data to and from compute nodes.

-> Split input data into 64MB chunks and store 3 copies of each chunk on nodes
	in cluster.

-> Map tasks work on locally available data if possible.

Combiner:
	Reduce-like task run on the Node after a Map task to decrease amount
	of data to be copied over the network.

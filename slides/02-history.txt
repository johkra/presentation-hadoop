1958:
	Lisp is invented by John McCarthy at MIT.
	Includes the Map function. (Reduce could be defined with Lisp 1.0, too.)
	These higher-order functions are basic blocks in functional programming.

Starting in the 60s:
	Use of distributed computing and computing cluster.

Around 2000:
	Google uses the MapReduce programming model for parallel,
	distributed computation on a cluster.

2004:
	A paper describing MapReduce is published.

2005:
	Hadoop as popular MapReduce implementation was created by Yahoo!
	employees.
